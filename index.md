## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Hwiyeong Lee, a second-year M.S. student in Artificial Intelligence Semiconductor Engineering at Hanyang University, supervised by [Prof. Taeuk Kim](http://galsang.github.io) and affiliated with the [HYU NLP Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/hyu-nlp/home).
Previously, I began my research career in my fourth undergraduate year under the supervision of [Prof. Sangheum Hwang](https://sites.google.com/ds.seoultech.ac.kr/daintlab/members/director?authuser=0) at Seoul National University of Science and Technology.

## Research Interests

I'm motivated to explore how LLMs acquire and process knowledge, and importantly, how we can manipulate it post hoc. Specifically, I approach LLMs as objects of scientific study, aided by the emerging line of work in the field of **Mechanistic Interpretability** to peel back the curtain on their inner workings. Ultimately, I aim to solve practical challenges like **Knowledge Editing** and **Unlearning** through a clear understanding of how LLMs operate.
