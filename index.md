## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Hwiyeong Lee, a second-year M.S. student in Artificial Intelligence Semiconductor Engineering at Hanyang University. My research explores on how LLMs learn and process knowledge, and more importantly, how we can manipulate it post hoc. <br>
Specifically, I approach LLMs as objects of scientific study, aided by the emerging line of work in the field of **Mechanistic Interpretability** to peel back the curtain on their inner workings. In the end, I aim to solve practical challenges like **Knowledge Editing** and **Unlearning** through a clear understanding of how LLMs operate.
